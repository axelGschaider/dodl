dodl
====

doesn't do much. You give it a file. It adds or removes a trailing dot.

Turns .foo to foo and bar to .bar

Why?
====
I often find myself creating files in "exoctic" locations and forgetting to make them a dot file . . . or making them dot files when I shouldn't So instead of

`mv /usr/local/bin/share/lib/init.d/service/file /usr/local/bin/share/lib/init.d/service/.file`

I can just type

`dodl /usr/local/bin/share/lib/init.d/service/file`

Approximately half as long . . . 

The Name?
=========
Austrian slang for idiot.
