dodl
====

doesn't do much. You give it a file. It adds or removes a trailing dot.

Turns .foo to foo and bar to .bar

Why?
====
I often find myself creating files in "exoctic" locations and forgetting to make them a dot file. So instead of

mv /usr/local/bin/share/lib/init.d/service/file /usr/local/bin/share/lib/init.d/service/.file

I can just type

dodl /usr/local/bin/share/lib/init.d/service/file

About half as long . . . 

The Name?

Austrian for idiot.
